### Important Note ⚠️

When running the notebook in Binder:
1. Make sure to run all cells in order from top to bottom
2. The first time you run it, wait for the NLTK data download to complete
3. If you get any errors, try running the cell again - sometimes network issues can cause temporary failures

## Project Overview

This project conducts a detailed analysis of Taylor Swift's lyrics using natural language processing and data analysis techniques. Key areas of investigation include:

- Temporal reference analysis (day/night imagery)
- Sentiment analysis across albums
- Word frequency and thematic patterns
- Chronological evolution of lyrical themes

## Prerequisites

To run this analysis, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required Python packages:
  ```
  pandas
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  nltk
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stars_align
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk
   ```

3. Download required NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## Data Sources

The project uses the following datasets:
- `taylor_swift_lyrics_2006-2020_all.csv`: Main lyrics dataset
- `album_year_name.csv`: Album metadata
- Individual album CSV files in the `lyrics/` directory

Original dataset curated by Jan Llenzl Dagohoy and published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-all-albums).

## Analysis Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning and normalization
   - Temporal reference extraction
   - Album metadata integration

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Day/night reference tracking
   - Chronological patterns
   - Album-level temporal distribution

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Overall sentiment trends
   - Temporal reference sentiment
   - Album-by-album sentiment evolution

4. **Word Frequency Analysis**
   - Most common terms
   - Thematic patterns
   - Temporal evolution of vocabulary

## Key Findings

- Significant variation in temporal reference patterns across albums
- Notable dip in time-related imagery around 2017
- Sharp increase in day-related references during 2019-2020
- Overall positive sentiment across the discography
- Distinct sentiment patterns between day and night references

## Usage

1. Open `solution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/Lab
2. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
3. Modify parameters or extend analyses as needed
